Bookmark Challenge:

My user story:
As a user I want to be able to see a lot of bookmarks

I want to be able to add new bookmarks to my list

I want to be able to delete bookmarks that are no longer useful

I want to be able to update any bookmarks

I want to be able to comment on bookmarks

I want to be able to tag bookmarks with a category

I want to be able to filter by their tagged category 

Users should only be allowed to change and manage their own bookmarks
